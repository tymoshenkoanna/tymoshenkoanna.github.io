									<h1>Who are we and what is the purpose?</h1>
								</header>
								<p>We are Anna and Jan and we are an engaged couple testing their limits. We are riding towards ey towards India on two motorcycles. We do not know nor where we are going, nor for how long. We know that an ideal outcome would be to reach India and we are willing to go until we both break down and confess our deepest truths. Anna provides camping and backpacking enthusiasm and Jan provides some basics of two wheeled-way of traveling.
</p>
									<p>So far, we have been running on a career treadmill and constantly chasing the next goal ahead of us. This has brought joy to us in the past but with every next goal met, the returns in terms of joy were diminishing. We haven’t been able to have a longer break and disconnect from a lifestyle that has the motto: “harder, better, faster, stronger”. We believe that this is damaging in the long run and once a while everybody needs to decouple from this lifestyle. Now it is the time. During this trip, we would like to try a minimalist lifestyle, experience nature and food, not plan much ahead and move rather randomly. Ideally, we would like to reach Goa, but we will see where the journey takes us!</p>

									<h3>Why motorcycles?</h3>
									<p>Through motorcycling one can fully experience the landscape around – one is at the mercy of the surroundings. All the sounds are heard, all the smells are smelled, and weather conditions are felt. This is different from traveling in a car where all is perceived as a mere show happening on the front window. It feels like one is not merely passing by but lives fully through the journey. It is a tiring way to travel which does not come for free but we believe this is how it should be.</p>
